## Development Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ly4nn3/simplate-project.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
VITE_SPOONACULAR=your_api_key
VITE_BIGBOOK=your_api_key
```
- Note: You'll need a Spoonacular API key to fetch recipe data. Get one at [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). And a BigBook API key to fetch book recommendations. Get one at [BigBookAPI](https://bigbookapi.com/),
